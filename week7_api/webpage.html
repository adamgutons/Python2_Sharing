    Undid revision 864426003 by [[Special:Contributions/Jennica|Jennica]] ([[User talk:Jennica|talk]]) - Strong objection to mass removal of cite parameter spacing, which is there for good reasons. Less objection to other changes, and some of it is even good, but I'm not going to spend two hours of my life doing a manual partial revert. Please get prior consensus for any such mass changes to this article.
