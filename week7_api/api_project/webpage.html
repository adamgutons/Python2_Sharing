    /* Radio and television commentary */ It was a short-form program, 1-2 minutes on weekdays, according to the sources. Probably much less entertaining than the white-winged warrior (ba-awk bawk-bawk-bawk) striking terror into the hearts of criminals everywhere.

    /* Early life and education */ The reason to remove it is the doubling.

    /* Radio and television commentary */

   <p>
    /* Bibliography */ Not a reliable source - big pictures, big print, very little substance.  Replaced only reference to it with more substiantive one.
   </p>
   <p>
    /* False statements */ Added info about "I wouldn't believe him..." line.
