   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ fixed citation.
   </p>
   <p>
    I disagree with these additions - they misplace the emphasis and suggest Warren claimed something she did not.
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ No, we don't get to pick and choose what part of the Bustamonte report we like.  You just can't leave off the first part of his conclusion. His conclusion is the 95 of her ancestry is European, not native. Please stop forcing your POV on the article.
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ Restored information that is reliably sourced to a well-known secondary source NY Times that another editor removed with the basic argument that he/she just did not like it. OR it could be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Wikipedia#Racial_bias]]
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ quoted reliable sourced, secondary source, NY Times, word for word so we can avoid:  [[Racial bias on Wikipedia]].
   </p>
   <p>
    Again, I disagree with your edits - please discuss on the talk page rather than edit-warring.
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Political positions */
   </p>
   <p>
    It wasn't, it's still a different campus, it's just as (if not more) accurate and illuminating. The prose links to the college, the infobox links to the parent university
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ add wikilink
   </p>
   <p>
    Undid revision 864825456 by [[Special:Contributions/NorthBySouthBaranof|NorthBySouthBaranof]] ([[User talk:NorthBySouthBaranof|talk]])
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ add per source used
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ Adding date and author; ce
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ The article actually does not prove that.
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ Corrected improper semi-colon use; replaced with comma.
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ as per talk page, removed the synthesis. The quote remains for now
   </p>
   <p>
    adjust/fix - quote what the report actually says, verbatim, rather than the (admittedly clearer!) reporter's wording that subbed in Warren's name for "this individual" -- will do that, in brackets, in my next edit, but wanted to first make an edit correcting the quote to what it is verbatim
   </p>
   <p>
    for clarity, replace "the individual" with Warren's name, in brackets, in the quote
   </p>
   <p>
    restore one bit which was removed without, afaict, discussion. and trim the NYT quote per talk (there does not appear to be consensus to include it at all, but I'll leave that to someone else).
   </p>
   <p>
    tag as duplicative of what was said above, and unnecessary detail
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ adding that "duplication" tag is a commentary by a Wikipeida editor, spec. NorthBySouthBaranof. that editor must go talk page to justify adding unsupported commentary in article. How is it duplicative? It is not. The 95 number is no where else in the article.
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ removed the word "significantly" because it was not the word that the Post used. included the actual words of the Post.
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ made it more accurate
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ Removed brackets around European Americans in the Kessler quote.  No need for bracket because Kessler said "European Americans" That’s the relevant statistic, indicating that her claim to some Native American heritage is much stronger than most European Americans.
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ Note that there is undue weight in this section - it has ballooned out of control.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dating maintenance tags: {{Undue-section}}
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ Tighten, trim duplicative, expand on Warren's statement.
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ don't re-add the POV pushing synthesis, this has already been discussed on the talk page
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ Removing biased article which simply stated that the numbers were wrong with no explanation.
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ Correcting a mistake: 6th generation is great-great-great-great-grandparent.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, Warren claimed her ggg grandparent was partly of native ancestry
   </p>
   <p>
    rv undiscussed removal of high-quality reliable source.
   </p>
   <p>
    There's nothing POV-pushing about stating what a reliable source states.
   </p>
   <p>
    tighten
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ as per talk page, removed the synthesis
   </p>
   <p>
    this is not synthesis - the article states, "Warren did clarify that she was talking only about family history "  Undid revision 865024108 by [[Special:Contributions/ScienceApe|ScienceApe]] ([[User talk:ScienceApe|talk]])
   </p>
   <p>
    Undid revision 865025516 by [[Special:Contributions/Gandydancer|Gandydancer]] ([[User talk:Gandydancer|talk]]) It's still a synthesis, leave the quote, don't re-add the synthesis
   </p>
   <p>
    Synthesis sourced to a reliable source is perfectly acceptable - that's literally what reliable secondary sources do.
   </p>
   <p>
    self-rv, will attempt a compromise version.
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ If your concern is "Synthesis," here's a direct quote.
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ Biased header. She has stated it. No consensus as to confirmation. Entire controversy is based around claims.
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Claims of Native American heritage */ who in family is relevant
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Claims of Native American heritage */ Biased unless we also include all the articles that state there was no Native North American DNA in the database she was compared to.
   </p>
   <p>
    no claim - NYTimes article is pretty straightforward in "Elizabeth Warren Has a Native American Ancestor." and the DNA test is pretty conlusive - "There is research showing that using these groups as references is accurate when differentiating between genetic ancestries at a worldwide level." so no issue with not using native american. Need sources that dispute her assertion; controversy appears to be about other things like she using that heritage for an advantage etc
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Native American heritage */ ancestry is less loaded I'd think
   </p>
   <p>
    Read the report itself. Rebecca Nagle explains it here: "'The science behind Warren’s specific DNA test used examples of Indigenous people from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, and included no sample from anyone who is Cherokee or even another Native American tribe from the Southeast (Cherokee traditional homelands)." https://thinkprogress.org/elizabeth-warren-dna-test-self-serving-dangerous-native-people-c3568a5977da/

    Inappropriate title per [[WP:CLAIM]]; edit is contrary to sources cited here. Discuss on talk page.
