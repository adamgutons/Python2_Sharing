    Restoring the former text which was well-sourced. As explained in the talk-page: That Khashoggi had another interpretation of Wahhabism and disagreed with the Saud house do not mean that he did not have sympathy for Muslim Brotherhood and Wahhabism. The sources are provided.
   </p>
   <p>
    /* Murder */ The government didn't say he was strangled. That comes from a CNN source, who says it might have been a chokehold, too.
   </p>
   <p>
    Don't conflate the government speaking on state TV with the government offficial speaking to reporters in the shadows. Two very different forms. Per the second source, more than fists were involved.

    /* Murder */ Neutral header till facts emerge and convictions come, refnamed fight source for lead.
