    Restored the lead, per talk page discussion that had support for restoration.

    Updating with current info. That she authored a best-seller book &amp; is hosting on Facebook Watch is significant, so I am adding it to the lead along with several references

    Undid revision 852581642 by [[Special:Contributions/LivinRealGüd|LivinRealGüd]] ([[User talk:LivinRealGüd|talk]]) [[MOS:BLPLEAD]]: avoid overloading the lead paragraph with various and sundry roles; instead, emphasize what made the person notable. Incidental and non-notable roles (i.e. activities that are not integral to the person's notability) should usually not be mentioned in the lead paragraph.

    /* top */ "miscarriage of justice" is very POV, no matter what one's views on this.  I've tried to change it to something more neutral, but it could probably be tweaked further
